# Module_21__Martian_Token_Crowdsale
## KaseiCoin, A new monetary system for Mars.
### Background

The Martian Aerospace Agency selected me to lead a project developing a monetary system for the new Mars colony. The new monetary system is based on blockchain technology as a cryptocurrency named KaseiCoin. (Kasei means Mars in Japanese.)
KaseiCoin will be a fungible token thatâ€™s ERC-20 compliant. A crowdsale of KaseiCoin (KAI) will allow people who are moving to Mars to convert their earthling money to KaseiCoin.

##  The KaseiCoin Token Contract

The KaseiCoin Token contract was complied using Solidity compiler version ^0.5.0

##  The KaseiCoin Crowdsale Contract

The KaseiCoin Crowdsale and Deployer Contracts were then complied.

I then deployed and tested the Crowdsale on the local block chain using Remix, MetaMask and Ganache.
